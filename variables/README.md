# Code explanation

## Package declaration

`package main`

In go similar to java and kotlin you need to declare the package where your code is located

## Variable declaration

In go, variables are declared as follows:

`var speed int`

 - var -> variable
 - speed -> name of variable
 - int -> type

## Rules for names

 - only can start with uppercase letters or letters

## Import library

`import "fmt"`

With this code you can import fmt library to your file and use functions like Println

## Print something in terminal with line break
`fmt.Println(speed)`
